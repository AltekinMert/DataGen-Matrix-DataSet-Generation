# DataGen - Matrix Dataset Generation

**DataGen** is a cutting-edge project designed to generate and manipulate matrix datasets efficiently using advanced algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques.

## Features

- **Dynamic matrix generation** with customizable dimensions and density.
- **Matrix manipulation tools** for expansion while preserving structural integrity.
- **Interactive GUI** for intuitive matrix creation and visualization.
- **Batch processing support** to handle multiple matrices simultaneously.

## Known Bugs

- Performance may drop slightly when processing extremely large matrices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ installed.
- Required Python libraries: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `tkinter`.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/aliemrepmk/DataGen-Matrix-DataSet-Generation
cd New Files
```

2. Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the application:

```sh
python -m gui.main_window.py
```

4. Use the interactive GUI to create, manipulate, and explore matrices.
